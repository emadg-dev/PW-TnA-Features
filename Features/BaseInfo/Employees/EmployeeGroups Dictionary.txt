EMPLOYEE GROUP ASSIGNMENT HISTORY DICTIONARY
========================================

Tenant
  A logical partition of the system’s data and configuration.
  Employee group history is evaluated within a tenant context.

Employee
  A person in the system identified by an EmployeeId (e.g., "266")
  who can belong to different Groups over time.

Group
  An organizational unit (e.g., RnD, Support, HR) that can be assigned
  to employees and influences business rules (e.g., holiday/overtime rules).

GroupId
  The identifier of a Group used in history records.

EmployeeGroups
  The employee’s group assignment history represented as a set of
  date intervals (rows), each linking the employee to a GroupId.

EmployeeGroups Row
  A single history record containing StartDate, EndDate, and GroupId,
  representing one continuous assignment interval.

StartDate
  The first date on which an EmployeeGroups row is effective.

EndDate
  The last date on which an EmployeeGroups row is effective.
  If EndDate is null, the assignment is open-ended (continues indefinitely).

Open-Ended Interval
  A history interval whose EndDate is null, meaning it continues until
  replaced by a later change.

Effective Interval
  A date range in EmployeeGroups during which a specific GroupId applies
  (from StartDate to EndDate).

Current Group
  The group determined by finding the EmployeeGroups interval that contains
  a specific date.

Indefinite Group Change
  A group change with no specified end date, producing an open-ended
  EmployeeGroups interval.

Fixed-Period Group Change
  A group change with both a start and end date, producing a bounded
  EmployeeGroups interval.

Reversion
  The automatic restoration of the previous group assignment after a
  fixed-period group change ends, starting the next day.

History Rewrite
  The process of updating EmployeeGroups by splitting and/or replacing
  existing intervals when a new change overlaps them.

Overlapping Date Ranges
  A condition where two EmployeeGroups intervals share at least one date.
  This is not allowed in the final history state.

Latest EmployeeGroups Row
  The most recent EmployeeGroups interval when ordered by start data.
