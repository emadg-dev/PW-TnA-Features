GROUP CYCLE DOMAIN DICTIONARY
========================================

Group Cycle
  The repeating schedule template of a Group, composed of Cycle Entries.
  Its total number of entries must match CycleLength.

CycleLength
  The required number of days (and therefore required cycle entries)
  in one repeating group cycle.

Cycle Entry
  A single day definition inside a Group Cycle that maps a DayInCycle
  to a DayOfWeek and an assigned ShiftId (or null when permitted).

DayInCycle
  The ordinal day number within the cycle.
  Valid range: 1..CycleLength.
  Each value must appear exactly once (no duplicates, no missing days).

DayOfWeek
  The weekday index associated with a cycle entry (e.g., 1..7).
  Used to align cycle entries to weekdays.

ShiftId
  A reference to an existing Shift assigned to a cycle entry.

Null Shift
  A special “no shift assigned” value (ShiftId = null).
  It is allowed only when it represents the day immediately after
  a 2-day shift (DurationDays = 2).

Two-Day Shift
  A shift with DurationDays = 2 that occupies two consecutive cycle days.
  This implies the following day is considered already covered by the shift.

HolidayShift
  A specific shift intended to represent off/holiday days.

Shift Overlap
  A condition where a shift assignment conflicts with another shift’s
  covered time/day span within the cycle (e.g., assigning a shift on the
  second day of a 2-day shift).

Cycle Boundary
  The transition from the last DayInCycle back to DayInCycle = 1
  (i.e., the start of the next cycle repetition).

Overlap Across Cycle Boundary
  A shift overlap that occurs when the last day’s shift coverage extends
  into DayInCycle = 1 of the next cycle repetition.

DuplicateDayInCycle
  A business error indicating the same DayInCycle value appears more than once.

MissingDayInCycle
  A business error indicating DayInCycle values do not cover 1..CycleLength
  exactly once.

DayInCycleOutOfRange
  A business error indicating DayInCycle is outside the valid range
  (less than 1 or greater than CycleLength).

ShiftNotFound
  A business error indicating a cycle entry references a ShiftId
  that does not exist.

NullShiftNotAllowed
  A business error indicating ShiftId = null was used in a position
  not permitted by the rules.

ShiftOverlapAcrossCycleBoundary
  A business error indicating the last day shift overlaps Day 1
  of the next cycle repetition.
