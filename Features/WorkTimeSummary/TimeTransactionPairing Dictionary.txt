WORK TIME PAIRING DOMAIN DICTIONARY
========================================

Work Time Summary
  A per-employee, per-date dataset used for work time processing.
  It contains shift context and processing outcomes and is ordered by date.

Work Time Summary Row
  A single date row in the Work Time Summary containing shift,
  group, and calendar context fields such as ShiftStart, 
  ShiftEnd, DurationDays, and processing flags.

Time Transaction
  A recorded time event for an employee on a specific date, identified by Id
  and a Time value.

Paired Time Transactions
  A list of time transactions that have been assigned to a day and may
  have been moved across dates for pairing completeness.

IsExit
  A boolean flag on a paired transaction indicating whether it is treated
  as an exit (OUT) event.

GroupIsMultiDayAttendance
  A group-level flag controlling whether transactions may be borrowed
  across adjacent dates to complete pairs.

Multi-Day Attendance
  The behavior enabled when GroupIsMultiDayAttendance is true, allowing
  cross-day redistribution of transactions for pairing.

Shift Window
  The time span defined by ShiftStart, ShiftEnd, and DurationDays, used as the
  reference for pairing and classification.

CrossDayTolerance
  A time tolerance value that controls whether a transaction near a day boundary
  can be considered related to an adjacent day’s shift window.
  (e.g., exiting 30 minutes after a multi-day shift ends, is included in that shift's
  pares time transaction list, if CrossDayTolerance >= 00:30:00)

MissingTimeTransaction
  A day-level status indicating that after processing, the day has an odd
  number of transactions (incomplete pairing).

CpgHoliday
  A per-day context value indicating holiday status for the calendar-per-group
  day (e.g., None when not a holiday).

BeforeShift
  A classification label for a paired transaction that occurs before the shift window.

InsideShift
  A classification label for a paired transaction that occurs within the shift window.

AfterShift
  A classification label for a paired transaction that occurs after the shift window.
